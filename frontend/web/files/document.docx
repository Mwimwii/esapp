The FPP should provide full details of the proposed project that will enable a decision on whether to 
provide grant financing under a specified MGF window. Please note that project implementation 
period should be realistic and not limited to the 2-year financing period of MGF. Costs should be 
fully estimated and not tailored to MGF grant allocation and applicant contribution only. If these 
sources are inadequate, applicant should seek additional financial support, as necessary, finance can 
be sought from MGF in two phases as long as the ceiling is not exceeded, and project completion 
date does not go beyond December 2023.
